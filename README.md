# A* Pathfinding Algorithm
A java implementation of the A* pathfinding/search algorithm with an interactive example.


This algorithm can be applied to any java project, here's how:

- Import the files into your project.
- Implement an instance of the Node class (Tile.java in the example provided).
- Implement an instance of the Network class (Grid.java in the example provided). This is simply a collection of nodes.
- Adjust the AStarAlgorithm.java file to suit your needs.
- Call the setStart(), setEnd() and solve() methods.
